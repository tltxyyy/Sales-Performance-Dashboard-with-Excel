# Sales-Performance-Dashboard-with-Excel

## Main Aim
* Provide a high level view of sales performance, by brand, vendor and category against the forecast.
* Sales and Forecast datasets are fed into the dashboard


## Dataset
#### Sample Sales Dataset (data is extracted separately by location)

#### Aggregated Forecast that combines raw forecast datasets from each location and year to one sheet:

## Dashboard
For both dashboards, users can easily select the format and time period they want to see and analyse with the help of data validation:
* Year
* Month
* Format
*   Month-to-Date
*   Year-to-Date

### Sales Figures
#### Main Dashboard showing aggregated sales
Sales mix by vendor and category are conditional formatted to make patterns and trends more apparent. Intuitive icons are also thoughtfully added like green ticks for when sales hit forecast and upwards arrow for when sales this year went above last year's.

#### Dashboard that can be filtered by sales outlet
Further conditional formatting serves to grey out those brands that are not in the outlet.
